# Next Caltrain PWA

This a Caltrain Schedule for modern Alcatel flip phones.
The Alcatel GO FLIP and SMARTFLIP phones run on KaiOS which is
build on a modern Firefox browser with geo location capabilities.
The SMARTFLIP supports full-screen mode but the GO FLIP does not,
so this scredule will function in both modes.

## Project Status

This is currently a UI prototype, but it will be trivial to port features from
[our other project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woodie/Caltrain-Schedule-MIDlet)
that runs on J2ME phones.
